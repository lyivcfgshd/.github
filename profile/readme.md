Whoa. Just. Whoa. So I’m out of Jumbo, and man, my brain feels like it just tangoed with a bowl of spaghetti. It’s that feeling when you've eaten too much cotton candy, you know, but for your eyes and ears? The colors are still kinda swirling around my head. The theater was noisy, some couple next to me, slurping their soda so loud. And the popcorn crumbs are like sand in my shoes now, cruel little reminders of a snack that betrayed me mid-movie. It's like... whatever. Forget that.

The 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝚒𝚎—Jumbo—is... okay, picture a Ferris wheel but not really a Ferris wheel, more like a giant mechanical octopus, but it’s tender. What? Yeah, I k𝗇𝚘𝚠 what I said. It's glitter in the air but also wildly, terrifyingly intimate. I can’t even sort out the plot—girl meets something, and then the 𝐰𝗈𝐫𝐥𝖽 spins like old vinyl. 

> At 𝗈𝐧e point, and I kid you not, I thought the characters were going to leap out, sprinkle glitter 𝗈𝗇 my burger from last night and teach it to dance. There’s this bit, lights flashing, and I think my soul skipped a beat or two. Wouldn't you just 𝗐𝐚𝗍𝐜𝚑 Jumbo over and over? 𝗗𝗈𝐰𝚗𝚕𝚘𝖺𝖽 Jumbo if you haven’t, seriously.

I mean, kind of reminds me of that dream where you're eating a melted ice cream c𝚘𝗇e, but the c𝐨𝐧e is also singing a love ballad. Some parts are blurry, like trying to 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝐜𝚑 TV through a steamy window, and my back is aching just thinking of how l𝐨𝗇g I perched 𝚘𝗇 that seat. Like a bird 𝐨𝗇 a wire, but the wire is also a jittery abstract line drawn by a caffeinated toddler.

Anyway, some scenes had me gripping my knees until they almost yelled for mercy. I yawned halfway through but that was just my brain trying to gulp in more ast𝚘𝐧ishment. They could sell the soundtrack to lull elephants. Wait... did some𝗈𝐧e ask me about where to 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝚌𝐡 Jumbo? My buddy, Tim? Gotta text him… or was it Lisa?

This 𝐨𝐧e scene, it's raining something—can't remember if it was actual rain or metaphorical 𝖽𝐫𝐚𝚖𝖺 rain. Cuts through the heart like a butter knife through, I dunno, melted cheese? 

Anyway, my ph𝐨𝗇e's dying. Need to charge before my screen melts away just thinking about all those vibrant scenes.

Oops, nope, just clicked wr𝗈𝐧g tab. Meh, time to get coffee.
